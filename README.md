Theory
(1) Selection Sort

Finds the minimum element in the unsorted array.
Swaps it with the elementt at the beginning.
Repeats the process for the rest of the unsorted array.
(2) Insertion Sort

Starts from the second element, and compare it with previous elements.
Moves larger elements one position to the right to make space for the current element.
Insert the current element in its correct position.
(3) Bubble Sort

Repeatedly compares adjacent elements.
Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
The largest (or smallest) element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
